For a properly submitted AMOE Entry Submission, the entrant shall receive one (1) one entry in the Promotion (each, an “AMOE Entry,” and together with the NFT Entries, the “Entries”), up to a maximum of one (1) AMOE Entry. To complete an AMOE Entry Submission, each entrant must legibly handwrite (no typing allowed) on a piece of paper included in the AMOE Entry Submission her/his: (i) full name; (ii) mailing address; (iii) telephone number; and (iv) Wallet address (collectively, “AMOE Registration Data”).

All AMOE Entry Submissions must be postmarked no earlier than June 3, 2022 and no later than June 4, 2022 to be eligible to receive Entries. Any improperly submitted AMOE Entry Submissions (i.e., any potential AMOE Entry Submissions having invalid or incomplete AMOE Registration Data) will be VOID</p><header><h1></h1></header><p>(c) Entry Limits/General Provisions. Each entrant’s Wallet must be maintained in good standing throughout the Promotion Period to remain eligible to receive a Prize. <strong>Entrants may not own more than one (1) Promotion NFT on the Snapshot Date. Any prospective entrant that owns more than one (1) Promotion NFT on the Snapshot Date will be automatically disqualified from participation in the Promotion.</strong> <strong>The total combined number of Entries obtained during the Promotion Period per entrant may not exceed one (1) in the aggregate</strong>. So, by way of example, if an entrant submits an AMOE Entry during the Promotion Period, that entrant will not be permitted to also obtain an NFT Entry during the Promotion Period. Multiple individuals are not permitted to share the same Wallet. Any attempt by any individual to obtain more than the permitted number of Entries by using multiple/different Wallets, e-mail addresses, identities, or any other method, will void all of that individual’s Entries and that individual will be disqualified from participating in the Promotion. Use of any automated system to participate in the Promotion is prohibited and will result in disqualification. Sponsor reserves the right to reject any Entry that it believes, in its sole and reasonable discretion, is fraudulent, incomplete or otherwise invalid. Sponsor is not responsible for Entries, notifications, claims or notices that are lost, late, illegible, misdirected, damaged, incomplete or incorrect. Entrants who are potential Prize winners may be required to provide some or all of the following: (i) Social Security Number; (ii) Photo ID; and (iii) any other information requested by Sponsor in connection with the Prize verification/award process (“Prize Winner Data” and together with the Site Registration Data and AMOE Registration Data, the “Registration Data”). <strong>SPONSOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ENTRIES, PROMOTION NFTS, WALLETS, CLAIMS OR NOTICES THAT ARE LOST, LATE, ILLEGIBLE, MISDIRECTED, DAMAGED, INCOMPLETE OR INCORRECT. IF YOU FAIL TO OBTAIN AN ENTRY FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, YOU WILL NOT QUALIFY FOR A PRIZE.</strong></p><p>(d) Cheating, Fraud and Abuse. By participating in the Promotion as an entrant, you represent and warrant to us that you will not engage in any activity that interrupts or attempts to interrupt the operation of the Promotion. Anyone who engages in, participates in, or displays behavior that may be interpreted, in Sponsor’s sole discretion, as unfair methods of participating in the Promotion as an entrant including, but not limited to, the use of multiple Wallets, the use of unauthorized or altered software or hardware to assist entry (e.g., scripts, bots, bot nets, and collusion with bots), intentionally giving other entrants a competitive advantage, Collusion (as defined below) with any other entrant(s), harassment of other entrant(s), breach of these Rules, or any other act (whether through the use of automated technology or otherwise) that unfairly alters an entrant’s chance of winning or constitutes the commission of fraud (collectively, “Abuse”), will be subject to immediate sanctions (as determined by Sponsor in Sponsor’s sole discretion), which may include, without limitation: (i) immediate MoonDAO membership termination and blocking of access to the MoonDAO community; (ii) any Prize that the applicable entrant may otherwise have been entitled to receive shall be void and forfeited; and (iii) any Prize received by the applicable entrant shall be subject to disgorgement and/or recoupment. In addition to the foregoing, Sponsor reserves the right to disclose or report any illegal activity to law enforcement and regulatory authorities. Without limiting Sponsor’s other available remedies, Sponsor may institute or seek any injunctive relief, civil and/or criminal proceedings against any entrant and/or any co-conspirators arising out of or related to the commission of Abuse including, without limitation, recovering all of Sponsor’s fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in connection with such efforts. For purposes of these Rules, “Collusion” shall mean where two (2) or more entrants or MoonDAO members collaborate or adopt a strategy (before, during or after the Promotion Period) in order to mutually gain an advantage, give an advantage to one (1) entrant, and/or harm other entrants.<!-- -->*<!-- -->*</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_3ly5" id="identification-of-entrants"><strong>IDENTIFICATION OF ENTRANTS:</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#identification-of-entrants" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Each Entry will be identified by the applicable Wallet address as collected and stored in the Promotion Database.

Within twenty-four (24) hours of the Snapshot Date, Sponsor will randomly select ten (10) Entries from the Promotion Database, selected in order from one (1) to ten (10), as potential Prize winners (collectively, “Prize Winner Selection”). The first potential Prize winner selected will be the potential Grand Prize (as defined below) winner. <strong>Entrants may not own more than one (1) Promotion NFT on the Snapshot Date. Any prospective entrant that owns more than one (1) Promotion NFT on the Snapshot Date will be automatically disqualified from participation in the Promotion.</strong> The potential Prize winners will be notified by the publication, on the Snapshot Date, of their respective Wallet addresses on Sponsor’s Discord® channel.

In addition, potential Prize winners may be required to provide Photo ID, and proof that they are the entrants that obtained the applicable potential winning Entries. Potential Prize winners may also be required to submit to confidential background checks to confirm eligibility and ensure that the use of any such person in advertising, promotion or publicity, will not pose a security threat or bring Covered Parties (as defined below) into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule or reflect unfavorably on Covered Parties as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion, and, in the event of such an eventuality, the applicable Prize may be forfeited.</p><p>Non-compliance by a potential Prize winner within the aforementioned time period may result in forfeiture of the subject Prize, with an alternative Prize winner selected. The return of a Prize and/or Prize notification as undeliverable may result in forfeiture of the subject Prize. In no case shall Sponsor be liable in any manner where a potential Prize winner has not received notification provided by Sponsor or where Sponsor fails to receive a response from a potential Prize winner within the required response period.</p><p>Each potential winning Prize Entry, as well as the associated information of the applicable potential Prize winner, must identically match the records maintained by Sponsor in order for a Prize to be awarded. In the event of a dispute, the information maintained by Sponsor will govern. Entries will be deemed made by the person who owns the subject Wallet associated with each Entry.</p><p>Where the Grand Prize winner forfeits the Grand Prize and/or is disqualified for any reason, the second Prize winner selected during the Prize Winner Selection process shall be deemed the potential Grand Prize winner. If the second Prize winner selected during the Prize Winner Selection process forfeits the Grand Prize and/or is disqualified for any reason, the third Prize winner selected during the Prize Winner Selection process shall be deemed the potential Grand Prize winner, and so on and so forth.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_3ly5" id="prize-description"><strong>PRIZE DESCRIPTION:</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#prize-description" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>(a) Alternate Prizes.
