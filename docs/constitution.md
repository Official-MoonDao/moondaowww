# MoonDAO Constitution

Version 1.0 | Last updated: Sep 12, 2022

## <ins>1. Mission, Vision, and Values</ins>

### 1.1 Mission

MoonDAO’s mission is to create a self-sustaining, self-governing settlement on the Moon by 2030 to act as a launch point for humanity to explore the cosmos.

### 1.2 Vision

The frontier of space represents the greatest opportunity to redefine our civilization. As we step forwards into the unknown, we find ourselves at a crossroads for our future.

MoonDAO believes in a bottom-up approach, where we are united by principles of equality, freedom, pursuit of happiness, justice, privacy, decentralization of power, transparency, private ownership, sustainability, and equal access to opportunity for anyone in the world, regardless of their origin.

We aim to bring life outside of our home planet for the benefit of human prosperity to all corners of the Earth. Not for the benefit of a few at the expense of others. MoonDAO will act as a hub for scientists, engineers, artists, philosophers, lawyers, and everyday people to come together and collaborate to build an optimistic future for everyone.

MoonDAO will build, fund, and promote public goods that help humanity achieve its mission. This includes projects related to space research, exploration, education, and inspiration. We are nation-agnostic, radically transparent, bottom-up, and open to anyone in the world to own, govern, and work.

### 1.3 Values

#### <del>Don’t</del> Can’t Be Evil

All our finances are public. All our work is done in an auditable and transparent way on our MoonDAO official communication channels to the extent permitted by law or operational security of its members. All our code is open source and readable by the public. Everyone has access to the same information to ensure everything is auditable and the community has full access to the state of the DAO.

#### Experimentation and Exploration

MoonDAO aims to create a culture that encourages direct experience of the unknown. We encourage novel research and curiosity-driven projects that give us new information about our place in the universe. This not only includes experiments in space, but also in governance, incentives, and using new technology to help people collaborate in new ways. We reward risk takers and encourage people who think differently.

#### Abundance Mentality

In everything we do, we aim to create positive sum games so that everyone wins, not just a small group at the expense of others. This means our output is open source, in the public domain, and a public good. We compose, rather than compete. This means no premine of tokens for projects, no special access to particular groups on the basis of nationality or financial means, and everyone has the same level playing field to cooperate and win with us. We give open access to our work to anyone in the world, and let anyone participate in the future we want to create, no matter where they are from or how much money they have.

#### Community First

We are a community, not a company. We never intend to be a company. No one voice can trump the DAO’s will. All leaders in the DAO are servants of the community. We invest in our members and give them opportunities to grow with the DAO for the long term. We give priority of work to our community members first, over mercenaries outside of our organization. We give the community real power, and discuss everything openly, letting the best ideas rise to the top, bottom up.

#### Long Term Focus

We play long term games with long term people. We keep our eyes on the horizon, and always strive to make decisions that make us stronger in the long term, even if it means short term sacrifice. We invest in the long term growth of our community.

#### A Home for Dreamers

We are here to do what others think is impossible. No goal is too crazy, ambitious, or outlandish. We embrace dreamers. If there’s a plan, we will hear it out and keep an open mind.

## <ins>2. Governance</ins>

MoonDAO is composed of three governing bodies: The MoonDAO Senate, Member House, and Executive branch.

### 2.1 Member House

MoonDAO’s Member House is composed of the holders of $vMOONEY, otherwise known as MoonDAO members. MoonDAO only has two official governance tokens [$MOONEY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x20d4db1946859e2adb0e5acc2eac58047ad41395?a=0x679d87d8640e66778c3419d164998e720d7495f6) and $vMOONEY. The total supply of $MOONEY is fixed, MoonDAO will never mint more of this token.

The only way for an individual to receive $vMOONEY is by staking $MOONEY. The $MOONEY token must be locked for a period of at least one week, to at most four years. In return, the person locking the token will receive a wallet-bound $vMOONEY linearly proportional to the length of staking. Each individual may only have one wallet holding $vMOONEY.

Voting power for each member is determined by the square root of the total number of $vMOONEY tokens held in their registered wallet.

#### 2.1.1 MoonDAO Members

A MoonDAO Member is any individual who holds wallet-bound $vMOONEY.

###### Rights

1. Right to vote on MoonDAO Proposals that go to the Member House voting stage with $vMOONEY.
2. Right to appeal removal from official channels of communication, as described in the ban appeal process.
3. Members with more than 250,000 $vMOONEY have the right to submit proposals to the Senate.

### 2.2 Senate

MoonDAO’s Senate is composed of Astronauts and Rocketeers. Each Senate member has the right to only one vote, even if they lead multiple projects. Proposals are first voted on by the Senate before being presented to the MoonDAO Member House. See section 2.4 for more information.

#### 2.2.1. Astronauts

Astronauts are trusted members of the DAO that have the responsibility to represent MoonDAO’s mission and values externally, and provide leadership to the DAO internally.

###### Election

MoonDAO members may hold an election for a new Astronaut if there is a vacancy. Candidate Astronauts may be nominated by MoonDAO members and must have been part of the Senate for at least six months. Each nomination must go through the senate with ⅔ majority vote. If there are multiple nominations that go through the Senate, then the DAO will vote among the candidates using $vMOONEY with weighted voting. There may be multiple rounds of voting until a Candidate Astronaut receives ⅔rds token majority votes to be confirmed as an Astronaut.

###### Term Limits

Astronauts serve for a two year term. After two years, the DAO must re-vote with 2/3rds token majority to confirm they stay as an Astronaut. They are eligible to remain an Astronaut for multiple terms. There can only be a maximum of three Astronauts at any given time.

###### Removal

Astronauts may be removed through the creation of a Proposal that is approved by the Senate with greater than ⅔ majority vote, and the MoonDAO members with greater than ⅔ majority vote over a five day voting period.

###### Rights

1. Right to jointly propose (all Astronauts must agree) the appointment or removal of Treasury Signers. Appointment or removal must be ratified by the Senate and Member House with 2/3 majority vote with a voting period of five days, and approval of 5/7 of the treasury signers.
2. Right to jointly propose (all Astronauts must agree) the removal of any member of the Senate for breaking the Code of Conduct, providing evidence of a reason for removal to the Senate transparently. This can be appealed and voted on for re-entry by a random drawing of seven MoonDAO Senate members.
3. Right to jointly propose (all Astronauts must agree) the termination of MoonDAO projects.
4. Right to appoint or remove MoonDAO moderators on official channels of communication.
5. Right to individually propose a salary approved by the Senate and DAO members.
6. Right to one vote in the Senate during the quarter(s) they are active.

#### 2.2.2. Rocketeers

Rocketeers are stewards of a [Project at MoonDAO](http://moondao.com/docs/project-guidelines) and are responsible for the execution of key objectives for the DAO.

###### Election

Rocketeers are elected through the successful passing of a Project Proposal.

###### Term Limit and Removal

Rocketeers are active in the Senate until the end of the quarter that their project ends, or if the community decides to end their project.

###### Rights

1. Right to appoint and remove members that are engaged on their objective within the project (i.e. Moonsettlers).
2. Right to make strategic decisions about the execution of their key objective and the handling of their budget as described in the Project system.
3. Right to one vote in the Senate during the quarter(s) when their Project is active.

### 2.3 Executive Branch

MoonDAO’s Executive Branch is composed of the multi-signature wallet signers of the MoonDAO treasury located at Ethereum Address 0xce4a1E86a5c47CD677338f53DA22A91d85cab2c9. There will only ever be seven signers, with an execution threshold of five people.

#### 2.3.1 Treasury Signers

Signers must create and sign transactions within five days of a proposal passing. Failure to do so may result in a warning and removal at the discretion of the Astronauts.

Signers’ identity must be made public by the DAO. Sensitive legal documents (such as Passports, ID Cards) will be securely stored by the DAO with only the Astronauts having access to it.

MoonDAO signers are required to have at least 250,000 $vMOONEY.

###### Election

Treasury signers are appointed by the Astronauts, and approved by the Senate and Member House with ⅔ majority vote, and 5/7 approval by the treasury signers. Term Limits There is no limit to the length of time a member can serve as a multi-signature member. Removal Treasury signers members can be removed by the Astronauts, and approved by the Senate and Member House with ⅔ majority vote, and 5/7 approval by the Treasury signers. Rights Right to object to a MoonDAO Proposal with written reasoning provided to the DAO of why the Proposal would put in jeopardy the long-term life of the DAO.

### 2.4 Proposal Process

All MoonDAO proposals must go through the following process.

#### 2.4.1 Creation

Any MoonDAO member can suggest a proposal and discuss them on the MoonDAO [governance forum](http://forum.moondao.com). The Proposal must follow the templates provided by the DAO, if the proposal does not follow its relevant template, then it will not be considered valid and will not go forward for a Senate vote.

#### 2.4.2 Feedback from DAO members

Proposals will go through a feedback process on the forum for at least a week, and the author may integrate feedback from the DAO. To officially submit the proposal to the MoonDAO senate, the proposal must be sponsored by a MoonDAO member with more than 250,000 $vMOONEY.

#### 2.4.3 Senate Voting

At the Senate voting phase, the proposal will be active for no longer than one month since its authoring in the governance forum. A 70% majority in the Senate is required for the proposal to go forward to vote from the MoonDAO Member House, with a quorum of 80% required. Senate votes are one vote per member.

#### 2.4.4 Member House Voting

At the MoonDAO Member House voting phase, if the proposal is a simple Yes/No, it will be adopted if the proposal achieves a 70% threshold according to the quadratic voting formula of $vMOONEY. If multiple options are presented, the proposal must have multi-choice voting, and voters can spread their voting power among the available options, and the one with a simple majority will be adopted. The voting period for Member House voting will be no less than five days.

#### 2.4.5 On-chain Execution

Following the approval of the Proposal by the Member House, if there is a transaction to be made from the MoonDAO treasury, the execution on-chain will occur within five days.

If any treasury signers decide to veto the proposal and not sign the transaction, they must include written reasoning and publish it for DAO members on why they believe the execution of the transaction would put in jeopardy the long-term health of the DAO.

## <ins>3. Organizational Structure</ins>

MoonDAO is organized into two major organizational structures, MoonDAO Projects and MoonDAO Guilds.

### 3.1 Projects

MoonDAO Projects are non-perpetual, goal-based teams that are voted by the community to act as trusted executors on behalf of the DAO to complete an objective. Projects can apply for a budget from the community, and once the project is passed, then the project stewards (i.e. Rocketeers) have all authority around who is part of the project, how the budget is spent, and strategy around execution. Once the project’s original mission is completed the team may be disbanded to work on other projects. [Specification for how MoonDAO projects operate can be found here.](http://moondao.com/docs/project-guidelines) Project stewards may have whatever consensus mechanism they would like internally (e.g. they may do one-person-one-vote, token voting, or just let the stewards have control). This includes how they decide over their votes in the Senate.

### 3.2 Guilds

MoonDAO Guilds are talent pools to onboard, orient, and train members to complete bounties for MoonDAO projects. Guilds are managed by Guild stewards, who are responsible for interviewing members to ensure they have the necessary skills relevant to their guild. Guild Stewards ensure the quality of guild members, and help them get started on MoonDAO bounties, and eventually projects.

## <ins>4. Rules of Coordination</ins>

### 4.1 Codes of conduct

MoonDAO members on official channels of communication are expected to be respectful to others and generally treat others as they themselves would like to be treated. Breaking these rules may result in removal.

#### 4.1.1 Attack the idea, not the person

Disagreement of ideas is natural and discussion is encouraged, but no personal attacks are allowed. Attack the idea, not the person. Attacking or targeting community members will result in removal. We have a strict "no asshole" policy. This includes disrespectful comments on the basis of race, sex, religion, political belief, sexual harassment, or bullying.

#### 4.1.2 Focus on the Mission, not $MOONEY

Keep comments about the token in designated areas. Our $MOONEY token is a governance token, and there is no expectation of profit with the token. Discussion about fluctuation of token prices is not productive towards our mission, MoonDAO is not built for day traders, it is built for long-term optimists. If you are here to primarily discuss the token rather than help build MoonDAO and progress its mission, this DAO is not for you.

#### 4.1.3 No unrelated content

No spam, scams, explicit content, soliciting or advertisements.

#### 4.1.4 Be honest

Although DAOs aim to be trustless, trust still forms the basis of all relationships. It is important to be able to trust members that you work with. Dishonesty that affects people’s ability to rely on you may result in removal.

#### 4.1.5 No sabotaging members

Any attempt made to sabotage the DAO or put it in a vulnerable position will result in removal. This includes sabotaging governance systems, blackmailing members, or preventing MoonDAO from proper functioning.

### 4.1.6 Transparent Communication

MoonDAO work is intended to be auditable and open to the community. Creating and participating closed channels of communication for work that should be occurring in designated MoonDAO channels may result in bans. Private communication for legal or operational security measures, however, is allowed.

### 4.2 Enforcement

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be done by MoonDAO Moderators.

#### 4.2.1 MoonDAO Moderators

Moderators are guardians of the DAO, removing members that break the Code of Conduct in official channels of communication.

###### Election

Moderators are appointed and removed by the Astronauts at their sole discretion.

###### Rights

1. Right to temporarily remove any member from MoonDAO official channels of communication for breaking the Code of Conduct. They must transparently provide a reason for the removal to the DAO. If the members have the right to vote in the MoonDAO senate, removal will require a review and approval by the Astronauts. If the member is a contributor on a Project, removal will require a review and approval by the Rocketeer overseeing the Project.

Once members have been removed they have to handover key information and assets required for proper MoonDAO operations (passwords, etc.).

### 4.3 Appeal Process

Every MoonDAO Member has the right to appeal removal from official channels of communication. After being removed, members may submit an appeal after 14 days have passed. Appeals will be reviewed by seven randomly selected Senate members, and through a majority vote they can decide whether the action should be reversed.

In general, removals are intended to be temporary. The community may forgive members, and apologies go a long way.

## <ins>5. Amendment</ins>

A proposal to amend the constitution can be made by a Senate member, and ratified by the MoonDAO Proposal Process, with a threshold higher than 80% of Senate majority and 80% of Member House majority. With a quorum of 80% in the Senate, and ten day voting period in the Member House.
