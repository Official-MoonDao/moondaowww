### **What are the Ticket To Space NFTs?**

MoonDAO’s Ticket To Space NFTs give anyone in the world who is of the legal age of majority the opportunity to enter a sweepstakes for a chance to win an opportunity to fly to space on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket (other than residents of the states of Florida and New York and where entry in the contest is otherwise prohibited by law). The Ticket To Space NFT has the following additional benefits:

- A 412 $MOONEY governance token airdrop.
- VIP Access to our launch party to celebrate our astronaut’s launch.
- First access to future MoonDAO projects.
- Discounts on future MoonDAO store merch and other collectibles!

### **How many Ticket To Space NFTs are there?**

There are 9060 Ticket To Space NFTs. Why 9060? That is the total number of seconds that Neil Armstrong was in EVA on the moon!

### **When are the Ticket To Space NFTs going to be made available?**

The Ticket To Space NFTs will be made available to all Moonlist members on June 3rd, 2022, at 8:00am PST. This will be our one and only Ticket To Space NFT offering.

NO PURCHASE OF A TICKET TO SPACE NFT IS NECESSARY TO ENTER THE CONTEST OR WIN A CHANCE TO FLY TO SPACE. PURCHASE OF A TICKET TO SPACE NFT WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR ODDS OF WINNING A PRIZE. SEE CONTEST RULES[PLEASE HYPERLINK] FOR A FREE, ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF OBTAINING AN ENTRY. THE CONTEST IS ONLY OPEN TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER, OR THE AGE OF MAJORITY IF GREATER THAN 18 IN THEIR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. THE CONTEST IS VOID IN FLORIDA, NEW YORK, PUERTO RICO AND WHERE OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW. ODDS OF WINNING DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES RECEIVED DURING THE CONTEST PERIOD, BUT CAN BE CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE NUMBER OF PRIZES BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ENTRIES RECEIVED.

### **What are the requirements to be selected to go to space?**

You must meet Blue Origin’s requirements to fly to space link. Blue Origin reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to evaluate all potential travelers and to approve or deny access to any voyage.

### **What is the Moonlist?**

The Moonlist is a list of individuals who have completed our NFT registration process. You must be verified on the Moonlist in order to mint our NFTs, including the Ticket To Space NFTs. You can register for the Moonlist here: <https://app.verisoul.xyz/moondao>.

Registration on the Moonlist is entirely free. In order to register on the Moonlist, you will need to register a Discord ID and Twitter profile, and submit an ID document with a picture of yourself. The process should take less than five minutes. If you need any assistance with the registration process, please go to the #MoonlistSupport channel for more information.

### **Will the Moonlist close? Is there a limit to the number of people that can be on the list?**

Everyone who is of the legal age of majority will have the opportunity to register on the Moonlist before we select the astronaut (and alternates) on June 11th at 7pm PST. There is no limit to the number of people that can register on the Moonlist.

### **How will the winning astronaut be selected?**

On June 11th, 2022, at 7:00pm PST we will choose the potential winning astronaut through a random drawing. We will select 10 potential prize winners in ranked order, and check that they meet the following requirements:

- At the time of selection, each potential winner’s wallet may have no more than one Ticket To Space NFT on June 11th, 2022, at 7:00pm PST; provided, that, ownership of a Ticket To Space NFT is not required for those individuals who entered through the alternative means of entry (“AMOE Entrants”).
- Each potential winner’s wallet is registered on the Moonlist; provided, that AMOE Entrants do not need to register a wallet on the Moonlist.
- Each potential winner may not be a resident of the states of Florida, New York, Puerto Rico or where the contest is otherwise prohibited by law.
- Each potential winner must be 18 years of age or older, or the age of majority if greater than 18 years of age in the potential winner’s jurisdiction.

Each potential prize winner that meets the above-mentioned criteria, as well as any requirements set forth in the Contest Rules, will win an additional 100,000 $MOONEY airdrop for being a potential astronaut. The first potential prize winner selected will also be the potential Grand Prize winner. The potential Grand Prize winner must submit for evaluation through Blue Origin’s flight approval process. In the event that the first potential Grand Prize winner is not able to fly with Blue Origin, or is otherwise disqualified, for any reason, we will approach the next alternative potential prize winner to determine if she/he qualifies and is able to fly, and so on. No potential prize winner may transfer her/his status as an alternate Grand Prize winner to any other person after the 10 potential prize winners have been selected.

### **What is $MOONEY?**

$MOONEY is MoonDAO’s governance token. These tokens are used to vote on proposals and other matters involving the DAO. There is no expectation of profit with this token. You are not receiving fractionalized ownership of the DAO’s assets in exchange for the token. No element of the $MOONEY and/or Ticket To Space NFTs qualifies or is intended to be an offering of securities in any jurisdiction, nor does it constitute an offer or an invitation to purchase shares, securities or other financial products.

### **MoonDAO has two Blue Origin tickets, who will receive the other ticket?**

Our community is reaching out and speaking to significant individuals that we can send into space to represent MoonDAO. The community will ultimately vote, using $MOONEY, on who will receive the other ticket from a list of candidates provided by MoonDAO.
