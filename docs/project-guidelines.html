non-perpetual, goal-based teams that are voted by the community to act as trusted executors on behalf of the DAO to complete an objective. Projects can apply for a budget from the community, and once the mission is completed the team is disbanded to work on other projects.</p><p>This document includes rules and guidelines for how projects are intended to work in a transparent and auditable way, how compensation will work for those teams, and how the community can voice their comments or concerns with the project team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_3ly5" id="how-is-a-moondao-project-created">How is a MoonDAO project created?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#how-is-a-moondao-project-created" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_3ly5" id="the-procedure-goes-as-follows">The procedure goes as follows:<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#the-procedure-goes-as-follows" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ol><li><strong>Build a team.</strong> Anyone in our DAO with the role of Moonsettler or above for at least a month can steward a project (in other words, proof of work is required before someone launches their own project, otherwise there is special approval needed to make an exception -- at the discretion of the Astronauts). Whoever is starting a project can either start a project on their own, or recruit people from our various guilds and put together a team. There can be a maximum of two stewards on any given project. Project stewards are expected to have MoonDAO be a primary commitment in their life. They are expected to act as a point of contact for the project and be active and responsive to make sure things move along and goals are achieved. Each person on the initial team of the project will become a Moonsettler, and they must have an OKR specified inside of the proposal. As a general rule, try to keep teams small (2-5 people) to begin.</li><li>Find a sponsor. A Sponsor is found from our DAO, either an Astronaut or Rocketeer. Sponsors are responsible for making sure the proposal meets all the requirements needed for a project to be properly put together. The sponsor could pull their support at any point in the process if they do not think the project is meeting the requirements. This pull of support will be recorded on the project with their reasoning, but the project can always find another sponsor if it wishes to continue. The Sponsor cannot be the same person as the steward. If a sponsor adds a project that does not meet the requirements of the project proposal (invalid proposal) they will receive a warning, if it happens twice the sponsor is penalized and not able to add more projects for 30 days.</li><li>Fill out a project template. A google doc template is filled out (below) and with the help of the Sponsor to workshop the project and make sure it fits all the requirements. Once the project meets all the requirements to be put up, then the sponsor will put it up under a special channel in the Discord that only the Astronauts or Rocketeers (sponsors) can post in.</li><li>Present project to DAO leadership. On a weekly basis the Rocketeers and Astronauts go on a call to evaluate the project and talk about it together. The people who put up the proposal need to be on that call to discuss the project and explain the proposal for people to get feedback. Rocketeers and Astronauts must attend this meeting every week. Absence of a Rocketeer or Astronaut without notice will result in a warning, and two absences without notice can result in removal from the role.</li><li>Get feedback from DAO leadership. The proposal must have an in-depth review from at least three Astronauts or Rocketeers, with feedback based on several axes (score 1-10 + an explanatory paragraph). The total numbers are provided to the DAO, front and center with summary statistics on each axis. Scorecard for reference</li></ol><ul><li>Does the project fit with the mission of MoonDAO?</li><li>Does the project fit with the values of MoonDAO?</li><li>Does the project improve MoonDAO in some significant way?</li><li>Is the project OKR following SMART guidelines (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound)? Is it ambitious, complex, and difficult enough to merit being a project?</li><li>Is the budget for this project justified (properly documented quotes, not excessive for the work that needs to be done)?</li><li>Does the person stewarding the project have a track record of accountability, honesty, and quality work at the DAO?</li><li>Do you feel confident that the initial team has the capacity to achieve what they are setting out to achieve? Is the team the right fit for the project? Are each of the moonsettler OKRs significant enough to merit a spot on the team?</li><li>Does the project conflict with any other existing project? (Redundant work, overlaps with another similar project)</li><li>Could this project generate positive revenue to the DAO and help us become sustainable?</li><li>(If it’s a budget increase proposal) Is the project on track to meet its OKRs successfully?</li><li>(If it’s a budget increase proposal) Is the team effective and efficiently using DAO resources?</li><li>(If it’s a budget increase proposal) Is the request for an increased budget reasonable?</li></ul><ol start="6"><li>Iterate on proposal. Projects can change their proposal based on feedback from the reviews. If the proposal is changed, they should notify the reviewers and they can update their scores based on the feedback. Proposals may be workshopped in this way with weekly reviews until the proposal feels good enough to move on to the next phase of review (at this point it is static and cannot change). The scores are for reference for voters, a low score does not necessarily mean it will not go up for vote.</li><li>DAO Discord vote by the broader team. After collecting final scores from people, the project team and sponsor can make a decision about whether they want to forward to the next phase of the review and get feedback from the broader DAO. An announcement will be made by the sponsor on the Discord with the document to a special channel where only Moonsettlers, Rocketeers, and Astronauts can react with a Yes or No. The scores from Rocketeers and Astronauts will be attached to this channel for people to review. The sponsor will also make a separate channel to only discuss that proposal. The proposal is active for a maximum of 7 days for it to reach a quorum of at least 75% of Moonsettlers, Rocketeers, or Astronauts, AND a ratio of at least 80% approval. If the thresholds are not reached then it does not go up for snapshot vote.</li><li>Present at Townhall. If the project passes the requirement from Step #7. The project steward will talk about the project at the weekly townhall and pitch the project to the DAO and take questions from people in the DAO about the project (no more than 5-10 minutes per project), they may also recruit from open roles from people that might be interested in joining. At this point the proposal is also translated into other languages and communicated to the rest of the DAO.</li><li>Vote on Snapshot. After the proposal is pitched, it’s included in that batch’s weekly snapshot for approval by the DAO and the DAO can vote on the snapshot for it to be passed with 80% approval.</li><li>Update roles and information in MoonDAO. Once passed, the project steward becomes a Rocketeer in the DAO, and the initial team will be Moonsettlers. The project steward then do the following:</li></ol><ul><li>They must post the Project proposal in the active projects channel so new members of the DAO can see the work that is being done.</li><li>The steward must create a multisig to collect the funds (they will be reimbursed for the cost of the multisig creation), and the funds for the project will be sent to their generated multisig.</li><li>A new channel is created by the project steward so their team can start working transparently inside of the DAO. Work must be primarily completed in that channel. Not elsewhere.</li></ul><ol start="11"><li>Progress updates. Every month of progress on the project, it will be reviewed by the Astronauts and Rocketeers in the weekly meeting, and they will assess the progress of the project. If the project is not meeting the expectations of the DAO, then a recommendation can be made to the DAO on a snapshot vote to end a project with their attached reasoning.</li><li>Extensions. If a budget needs to be increased it must go through the same steps 3-10 with a justification for budget extension.</li><li>Project ends. Once the project is completed the excess funds are returned to the DAO multisig, a final report is created to the DAO with the use of all funds and other relevant information about the project. The project steward must create a Coordinape within one week of the project ending. Tokens from that coordinape will be released at the end of the quarter (see below for more details on how this is done).</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_3ly5" id="moonsettler-expectations">Moonsettler expectations<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#moonsettler-expectations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Moonsettlers must always have an OKR that they’re working towards within the project. They may join more than one project if they meet the requirements for multiple projects.</p><p>The sponsor, at any time and at their sole discretion, can remove a moonsettler from their project if they are not meeting the expectations required of them inside of the project. If they are removed they are still eligible to get the Coordinape bonus for the work they’ve completed so far inside of the project.</p><p>If a Moonsettler completes their OKR and does not have a new objective, it is their responsibility to go to the Project steward and find work that they can complete to help the project. If there is no work that can be completed, they must either join another project to continue their Moonsettler role, create a project and become a rocketeer, or forgo their Moonsettler role. No Moonsettler can continue with their role without having something they are actively working on. Again, if they are no longer needed, they will still get paid on the project for the work that they completed to date.</p><p>Moonsettlers should create a weekly update in their project channel with the work that they’ve done that week and their priorities for the upcoming week.</p><p>At the end of a project, Moonsettlers will receive a Coordinape bonus for the project that they’ve completed. Moonsettlers are encouraged to record the work that they do to present at the end of the pay period. It is recommended to post weekly updates of the work you’ve done to keep a record for the DAO.</p><p>Moonsettlers that complete their duties with the DAO in good standing will be changed to a Voyager role and can continue to help in their own capacity outside of the Moonsettler expectations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_3ly5" id="rocketeer-expectations">Rocketeer Expectations<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#rocketeer-expectations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A rocketeer is equivalent to a project steward.</p><p>Project stewards must provide weekly updates to the DAO on their project’s progress at the weekly townhalls, where the community can share their thoughts, comments, or concerns with the team. The updates should also be written down and shared in the Discord.</p><p>Project stewards are responsible for making sure each transaction on the multisig is recorded with a justification (who was paid, how much, key deliverable from the payment).</p><p>Project stewards are responsible for making sure the moonsettlers on their team are completing their work on time, and keeping an updated list of moonsettlers that are on their project.

The steward must create a multisig to collect the funds (they will be reimbursed for the cost of the multisig creation), and the funds for the project will be sent to their generated multisig. A new channel is created by the project steward so their team can start working transparently inside of the DAO. Work must be primarily completed in that channel. Not elsewhere.</p><p>Every month of progress on the project, the project will be reviewed by the Astronauts and Rocketeers in their weekly meeting, with attendance by the project stewards, and they will assess the progress of the project. If the project is not meeting the expectations of the DAO, then a recommendation can be made to the DAO on a snapshot vote to end a project with their attached reasoning.</p><p>Projects must work transparently in the DAO such that anyone in the DAO can audit the work that is being done, and can weigh in if they have questions, comments, or concerns.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_3ly5" id="how-can-someone-be-added-as-a-new-moonsettler-on-a-project">How can someone be added as a new Moonsettler on a Project?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#how-can-someone-be-added-as-a-new-moonsettler-on-a-project" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If Project needs work done that is best completed by a bounty rather than by anyone on the initial team, then projects can break down those tasks into a bounty board for things that can get done by anyone in the community.</p><p>The bounties will be shared first in our MoonDAO guilds to see if there are interested people there.

All Moonsettlers must have completed at least one successful bounty before being added to a project team.</p><p>The Project steward must register the moonsettler as a member of the DAO and the Astronauts must sign off on the addition to make sure that the moonsettler has a properly scoped role inside of the project with deliverables.</p><p>The steward will then add the moonsettler to a new channel where the steward can introduce the member of the project with a bio and add their responsibility inside of the project.
